You see, there seems to be a "leader" in these parts that is the cause behind the rise in Beasts. 

Our last foraging team believed its home to be by the far North-East of the Enchanted Forest. They left to slay it... and never returned.

If you can defeat it, it may ease our burdens and make supply routes available once more.

And hopefully... lost Church members will be found on the way.

However, be careful, Pilgrim. This Beast is unlike any you have seen before. I would suggest you gear up and hone your skills first.
